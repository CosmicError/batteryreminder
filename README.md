# Usage and Installation Instructions

### Windows
This application requires Python to be installed. If you don't have it already, [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/#article-header "Downloads page") it.\
Once Python is installed, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/coolkiwiii/batteryreminder/releases "Releases") page and download *BatteryReminder-Windows.exe*. Next, hold Win+R to open Run. In Run type in ```shell:startup```. Then, copy *BatteryReminder-Windows.exe*  to that location. This makes the program start up everytime your computer boots into Windows.

### macOS/Mac OS X
*Note: Mac OS X 10.7 and lower are NOT supported.*\
Requirements:
* Python
* brew\
First, if you don't have it already, install Python. Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/ "Downloads page") to download it. Run the installer. After Python is installed, you must install ```brew```, if you don't have it already. Open up a terminal window (*If you can't find it, use Spotlight to search for "Terminal"*). Once you are in the terminal, copy and paste ```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```. This will install ```brew```. Next, type ```brew install terminal-notifier``` in the terminal. Once that is done, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/coolkiwiii/batteryreminder/releases "Releases") page and download *BatteryReminder-Mac.app*.
